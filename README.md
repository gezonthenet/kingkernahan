# Strava CR Auditor

A simple webpage that uses the Strava API V3 to view your own KOMs/CRs on a single page with an option to download them as a csv file.

## Background

Currently the Strava website presents users with a paginated view of their KOMs/CRs. If you have a lot of CRs and want to easily keep track or search for particular CRs it is time consuming paginating through their website.

## Permissions

This tool requires read permissions to your activities. Your personal information or activities is not stored anywhere by me.
